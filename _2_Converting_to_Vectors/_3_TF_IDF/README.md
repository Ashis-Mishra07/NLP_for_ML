### TF-IDF ( Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency )

- Term Frequency(TF) = No. of rep. of words in sentence / No. of words in sentence
- IDF = LOGe( No. of sentence / No. of sentence containing the word )



#### Advantages
- Implementation is intuitive
- fixed size -> vocal size
- word importance is getting capture ( weightage will be given more if importance is more )



#### Disadvantage
- Sparcity is there
- OOV (out of vocabulary)  means if any new added it will get ignored

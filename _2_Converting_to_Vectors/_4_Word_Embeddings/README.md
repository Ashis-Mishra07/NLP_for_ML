### Advantages 
- Before we used to get a sparse matrix( many 0 and 1) , but now here we will get a dense matrix ( word2vec) which reduces the overfitting chance .
- for every other word we find an accurate way of getting the correlation between them .
- now semantic info. are now getting captured 
- not depending on vocabulary size , there is fixed set of dimensions .
- google Word2Vec has [300 dimensions]
- OOV ( out of vocabulary)  : still there is but we have less chance pof getting the error fue to it since semantics are not capturing .
